## How It Works

1. Visit wise.com
2. Click the 🎤 "Record Voice Invoice" button (appears in top-right corner)

1. **Navigate to Wise**: Go to [wise.com](https://wise.com)

2. **Start Recording**: Look for the purple 🎤 button in the top-right corner of the page

3. **Speak Clearly**: Say your invoice details. Example:
   ```
   "Send 500 euros to John Smith, account number 1234567890, 
   reference: March 2024 rent payment"
   ```

### Tips for Best Results

- **Speak clearly** and at a moderate pace

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **Web Speech API**: Browser-native speech recognition (no API costs!)
- **MediaRecorder API**: For audio recording
- **jsPDF**: Client-side PDF generation
- **Chrome Extension APIs**: Storage and content script injection

### How It Works Technically

1. **Injection**: Content script injects a button into wise.com pages
2. **Recording**: MediaRecorder captures audio, Web Speech API transcribes in real-time
3. **Processing**: Transcript is formatted and converted to PDF using jsPDF
4. **Storage**: PDF stored temporarily in Chrome's local storage
5. **Upload**: File can be downloaded or auto-filled into Wise's upload forms

### Privacy & Security

- ✅ All processing happens client-side in your browser
- ✅ No data is sent to external servers
- ✅ Voice recordings are not stored permanently
- ✅ Chrome storage is cleared after PDF upload/download
- ✅ Requires microphone permission (standard Chrome permission)

## Browser Compatibility

| Browser | Support | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Chrome | ✅ Full | Recommended |
| Edge | ✅ Full | Chromium-based |
| Firefox | ⚠️ Partial | Manifest V3 support varies |
| Safari | ❌ No | Different extension system |

## Troubleshooting

### "Microphone permission denied"
- Click the 🔒 icon in the address bar
- Allow microphone access for wise.com

### "Speech recognition not supported"
- Ensure you're using Chrome or Edge
- Check that you're on a secure connection (HTTPS)

### "Button doesn't appear"
- Refresh the page
- Check that the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions/`
- Try visiting different pages on wise.com

### "PDF auto-upload not working"
- This feature is experimental
- Use the "Download PDF" button as a fallback
- Manually upload the PDF to Wise

## Development

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/maxploter/wise-voice-payments.git
cd wise-voice-payments

# Install dependencies (for jsPDF)
npm install

# Copy jsPDF to libs folder
cp node_modules/jspdf/dist/jspdf.umd.min.js libs/
```

### Making Changes

1. Edit the files as needed
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click the refresh icon on the extension card
4. Reload wise.com to see changes

### Building Icons

Icons are generated using Python PIL:

```bash
python3 create_icons.py
```
